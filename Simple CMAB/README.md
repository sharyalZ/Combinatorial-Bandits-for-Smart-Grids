## Simple CMABs
It is a repository containing the implementation of combinatorial multi-armed bandit algorithm with Thompson Sampling to solve combinatorial optimization problems involving single agent as well as multiple agents in a decentralized environment. Implemented algorithm is inspired from *[here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372447605_Decentralized_Smart_Charging_of_Large-Scale_EVs_using_Adaptive_Multi-Agent_Multi-Armed_Bandits)*.
